# ML_Coursework2

Only the main script needs to be run which contains all preprocessing and convolutional neural network. When running the main script please ensure your current working directory contains the CUB_200_2011 file and the bird_labs.csv to run.

8 of the 11788 images are greyscale, so have been removed as they cause problems in code and are insignificant
